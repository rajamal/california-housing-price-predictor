# California Housing Price Predictor
The Repository explores predicting California housing prices in the 1990s using a `Linear Regression Model`. We use the `scikit` for the project and data required is available with scikit.

## Data

**Target** : `Median house value` - for California districts, expressed in hundreds of thousands of dollars ($100,000).

This dataset was obtained from the StatLib repository. https://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~ltorgo/Regression/cal_housing.html

This dataset was derived from the 1990 U.S. census, using one row per census block group. A block group is the smallest geographical unit for which the U.S. Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people).

A household is a group of people residing within a home. Since the average number of rooms and bedrooms in this dataset are provided per household, these columns may take surprisingly large values for block groups with few households and many empty houses, such as vacation resorts.

## Results
| Metric        | Value                        |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| R2 Score      | 0.5891435539852219           |
| MSE           | 0.5472825858911409           |


## Future Explorations
1. Evaluating whether to normalize Longitude and Latitude attributes of the dataset. Is there better way to represent the latitude and longitudes
2. Evaluating if we can add external data to improve the model and its accuracy
3. Evaluation of other feature engineering techniques to get better representative features.


## FAQs
#### What is Linear Regression
A linear regression model describes the relationship between a dependent variable, y, and one or more independent variables, X. The dependent variable is also called the response variable. Independent variables are also called explanatory or predictor variables. Continuous predictor variables are also called covariates, and categorical predictor variables are also called factors. The matrix X of observations on predictor variables is usually called the design matrix.
